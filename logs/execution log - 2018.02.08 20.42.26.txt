 |      .   @param src Sample image to get a prediction from.
 |      .   @param label The predicted label for the given image.
 |      .   @param confidence Associated confidence (e.g. distance) for the predicted label.
 |      .   
 |      .   The suffix const means that prediction does not affect the internal model state, so the method can
 |      .   be safely called from within different threads.
 |      .   
 |      .   The following example shows how to get a prediction from a trained model:
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   using namespace cv;
 |      .   // Do your initialization here (create the cv::FaceRecognizer model) ...

 |      .   int predicted = model->predict(img);

 |      .   double predicted_confidence = 0.0;
 |      .   // Get the prediction and associated confidence from the model

 |      .   
 |      .   To implement this method u just have to do same internal cycle as in predict(InputArray src, CV_OUT int &label, CV_OUT double &confidence) but

 |      .   @brief Loads a FaceRecognizer and its model state.
 |      .   
 |      .   Loads a persisted model and state from a given XML or YAML file . Every FaceRecognizer has to
 |      .   overwrite FaceRecognizer::load(FileStorage& fs) to enable loading the model state.
 |      .   FaceRecognizer::load(FileStorage& fs) in turn gets called by
 |      .   FaceRecognizer::load(const String& filename), to ease saving a model.

 |  train(...)
 |      train(src, labels) -> None
 |      .   @brief Trains a FaceRecognizer with given data and associated labels.
 |      .   
 |      .   @param src The training images, that means the faces you want to learn. The data has to be
 |      .   given as a vector\<Mat\>.
 |      .   @param labels The labels corresponding to the images have to be given either as a vector\<int\>
 |      .   or a
 |      .   
 |      .   The following source code snippet shows you how to learn a Fisherfaces model on a given set of
 |      .   images. The images are read with imread and pushed into a std::vector\<Mat\>. The labels of each
 |      .   image are stored within a std::vector\<int\> (you could also use a Mat of type CV_32SC1). Think of
 |      .   the label as the subject (the person) this image belongs to, so same subjects (persons) should have
 |      .   the same label. For the available FaceRecognizer you don't have to pay any attention to the order of
 |      .   the labels, just make sure same persons have the same label:
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   // holds images and labels
 |      .   vector<Mat> images;
 |      .   vector<int> labels;
 |      .   // images for first person
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person0/0.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(0);
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person0/1.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(0);
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person0/2.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(0);
 |      .   // images for second person
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person1/0.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(1);
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person1/1.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(1);
 |      .   images.push_back(imread("person1/2.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)); labels.push_back(1);
 |      .   @endcode
 |      .   
 |      .   Now that you have read some images, we can create a new FaceRecognizer. In this example I'll create
 |      .   a Fisherfaces model and decide to keep all of the possible Fisherfaces:
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   // Create a new Fisherfaces model and retain all available Fisherfaces,
 |      .   // this is the most common usage of this specific FaceRecognizer:
 |      .   //
 |      .   Ptr<FaceRecognizer> model =  FisherFaceRecognizer::create();
 |      .   @endcode
 |      .   
 |      .   And finally train it on the given dataset (the face images and labels):
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   // This is the common interface to train all of the available cv::FaceRecognizer
 |      .   // implementations:
 |      .   //
 |      .   model->train(images, labels);
 |      .   @endcode
 |  
 |  update(...)
 |      update(src, labels) -> None
 |      .   @brief Updates a FaceRecognizer with given data and associated labels.
 |      .   
 |      .   @param src The training images, that means the faces you want to learn. The data has to be given
 |      .   as a vector\<Mat\>.
 |      .   @param labels The labels corresponding to the images have to be given either as a vector\<int\> or
 |      .   a
 |      .   
 |      .   This method updates a (probably trained) FaceRecognizer, but only if the algorithm supports it. The
 |      .   Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) recognizer (see createLBPHFaceRecognizer) can be updated.
 |      .   For the Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces method, this is algorithmically not possible and you have to
 |      .   re-estimate the model with FaceRecognizer::train. In any case, a call to train empties the existing
 |      .   model and learns a new model, while update does not delete any model data.
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   // Create a new LBPH model (it can be updated) and use the default parameters,
 |      .   // this is the most common usage of this specific FaceRecognizer:
 |      .   //
 |      .   Ptr<FaceRecognizer> model =  LBPHFaceRecognizer::create();
 |      .   // This is the common interface to train all of the available cv::FaceRecognizer
 |      .   // implementations:
 |      .   //
 |      .   model->train(images, labels);
 |      .   // Some containers to hold new image:
 |      .   vector<Mat> newImages;
 |      .   vector<int> newLabels;
 |      .   // You should add some images to the containers:
 |      .   //
 |      .   // ...
 |      .   //
 |      .   // Now updating the model is as easy as calling:
 |      .   model->update(newImages,newLabels);
 |      .   // This will preserve the old model data and extend the existing model
 |      .   // with the new features extracted from newImages!
 |      .   @endcode
 |      .   
 |      .   Calling update on an Eigenfaces model (see EigenFaceRecognizer::create), which doesn't support
 |      .   updating, will throw an error similar to:
 |      .   
 |      .   @code
 |      .   OpenCV Error: The function/feature is not implemented (This FaceRecognizer (FaceRecognizer.Eigenfaces) does not support updating, you have to use FaceRecognizer::train to update it.) in update, file /home/philipp/git/opencv/modules/contrib/src/facerec.cpp, line 305
 |      .   terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
 |      .   @endcode
 |      .   
 |      .   @note The FaceRecognizer does not store your training images, because this would be very
 |      .   memory intense and it's not the responsibility of te FaceRecognizer to do so. The caller is
 |      .   responsible for maintaining the dataset, he want to work with.
 |  
 |  write(...)
 |      write(filename) -> None
 |      .   @brief Saves a FaceRecognizer and its model state.
 |      .   
 |      .   Saves this model to a given filename, either as XML or YAML.
 |      .   @param filename The filename to store this FaceRecognizer to (either XML/YAML).
 |      .   
 |      .   Every FaceRecognizer overwrites FaceRecognizer::save(FileStorage& fs) to save the internal model
 |      .   state. FaceRecognizer::save(const String& filename) saves the state of a model to the given
 |      .   filename.
 |      .   
 |      .   The suffix const means that prediction does not affect the internal model state, so the method can
 |      .   be safely called from within different threads.
